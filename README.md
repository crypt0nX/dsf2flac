# dsf2flac.dop.dsd256
Updated conversion tool for DSD files

This tool is a fork from https://code.google.com/archive/p/dsf2flac/

AudioFile.h is a modified version from https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile

I wish many thanks to all the authors involved in such tool. For me this is the only free way to play DSD256 files on my dac without getting mad.

Support conversion from dsf or dff to wav files via DoP. DSD256 is supported by converting source dsf or dff to a DoP stream encapsulated in a 2 channels wav file 705600hz, 24 bit as flac actually does not support sample rates above 655350.

Well tested up to DSD256 dsf to DoP wav conversion with rme ADI 2 DAC.

The list of available alsa device names can be obtained with alsa command: `aplay -L`

Replace everything after the `ffmpeg -f` parameter with your alsa device name to try it out with your DAC.
